## Description

What do we know about "new"?
The "new" operator lets you create an instance of a user-defined object 
or one of the built in object types that has a constructor function.

The "new" keyword does the following things:
1. Creates a blank Javascript object
2. Adds a property to the new object that links to the constructor 
function's prototype object
3. Binds the newly created object instance as the "this" context (all 
references to "this" in the constructor function now refers to the 
object created in the first step).
4. Returns "this" if the function doesn't return an object
